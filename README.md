Better Way enables its users to hold themselves accountable for their
environmental impacts on a daily basis regarding transportation. The app uses real-time GPS tracking to keep track of not only money spent on transportation but total environmental impact as well. The app also includes support for multiple user accounts accessible from any device with the app installed. 

Several bugs with accounts and app functionality have been eliminated since the beta version.

After extensive user testing and taking the feedback into account, we decided against implementing some of the more advanced sharing and social functionality we originally wanted to include due to compatibility and ease of use issues.
